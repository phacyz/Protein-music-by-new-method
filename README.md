Protein Music composition of nnhanced musicality by  music style guided exploration of diverse amino acid properties
Inspired by the traceable analogies between protein sequences and music notes, we developed algorithms of protein music composition of  enhanced musicality by fine-tuned protein-to-music mapping guided by the features of specific music style. We analyzed the musical features of a specific music style (Fantasy-Impromptu style), and used the quantized features to guide a broad exploration of diverse amino acid properties (104 properties, multiple sequence patterns and variations of biological relevance) for a novel protein-to-music algorithm, aimed at enhanced musicality. This algorithm was applied to 18 proteins of various biological functions. The MIDI files of these protein music are provided here
